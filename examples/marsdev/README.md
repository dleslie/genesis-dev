## Example Projects

### SGDK Skeleton
An SGDK sample program based on the moon tutorial.
It can be used as a starting point for SGDK projects.

### MD Skeleton
A bare-bones program that prints Hello World.
Can be used as a starting point for people who want to do it all themselves,
rather than use SGDK.

### MD Newlib Test
An extension of the MD Skeleton that uses Newlib, and runs a few functions to
make sure they're working right.

### MD C++ Test
A test project to make sure C++ works properly.

### 32X Skeleton
Bare-bones 32X program, based on [ammianus's example](https://github.com/ammianus/32xHomebrew).

### Echo Test
Test ROM for Echo's C API.
Z80 ASM macros have been converted to sjasm syntax to remove the need for z80asm.

### Sonic
Builds the Sonic disassembly (converted to GNU syntax). Don't tell Sega.

### Stage9 Sample
An example program for a map editor I made. Should really finish it someday.
The graphics came from OpenGameArt ([details](sgdk-stage9-sample/res/resources.res))
